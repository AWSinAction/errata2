Unfortunately, Elastic Beanstalk introduced a backward-incompatible (aka breaking) change that no longer allows environments without an [instance profile](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/concepts-roles-instance.html). Therefore, the example is broken, and we can not offer an easy fix.
